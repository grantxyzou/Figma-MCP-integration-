# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Fluent 2 Component Library

This guide provides multiple options for deploying your Fluent 2 Component Library for testing and sharing.

## 🎯 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free & Automatic)

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repo: `https://github.com/grantxyzou/Figma-MCP-integration-`
   - Navigate to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push
   ```

3. **Access your app:**
   - URL: `https://grantxyzou.github.io/Figma-MCP-integration-/`
   - Updates automatically on every push to main branch

**Benefits:** ✅ Free, ✅ Automatic, ✅ Custom domain support

---

### Option 2: Vercel (Recommended for Production)

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Connect to GitHub (one-time):**
   - Follow prompts to connect your repo
   - Auto-deploys on every git push

**Benefits:** ✅ Extremely fast, ✅ Auto-deployments, ✅ Custom domains, ✅ Analytics

---

### Option 3: Netlify

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

**Benefits:** ✅ Great performance, ✅ Form handling, ✅ Function support

---

### Option 4: Local Network Sharing

**For immediate testing with colleagues:**

```bash
# Start development server with network access
npm run dev -- --host

# Or use the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

Then share the Network URL shown in terminal (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5173`)

---

## 🛠️ Using the Deployment Script

We've included a helper script for easy deployment:

```bash
# Make it executable (first time only)
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment helper
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Build your application
- ✅ Validate the build
- ✅ Provide deployment options
- ✅ Offer local preview

---

## 🔧 Environment Considerations

### Production Build Features:
- **Optimized bundle size** - Smaller, faster loading
- **Asset optimization** - Compressed images and code
- **TypeScript compilation** - Full type checking
- **Security headers** - Production-ready configuration

### Test Environment Setup:
- All external links (Storybook, Fluent 2 docs) will work
- Dashboard metrics reflect real project data
- MCP server features will be disabled (frontend-only)
- Navigation and UI components fully functional

---

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### GitHub Pages:
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- View at: `https://grantxyzou.github.io/Figma-MCP-integration-/`

### Vercel:
- Dashboard: `https://vercel.com/dashboard`
- Analytics and performance metrics included

### Netlify:
- Dashboard: `https://app.netlify.com/`
- Deploy logs and site analytics

---

## 🔗 Share Your Test Environment

Once deployed, share these with your testers:

**Live URL Examples:**
- GitHub Pages: `https://grantxyzou.github.io/Figma-MCP-integration-/`
- Vercel: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- Netlify: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

**What testers can do:**
- ✅ Explore all 8 implemented Fluent 2 components
- ✅ View the comprehensive dashboard with real metrics
- ✅ Test the responsive navigation system
- ✅ Review component documentation and guides
- ✅ Access all the "Get Started" resources

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **MCP Features:** The deployed version won't have active Figma MCP integration (requires local server)
2. **External Links:** Links to Storybook and documentation will work as intended
3. **Data:** All metrics and component data are real and reflect your actual project
4. **Performance:** Production builds are significantly faster than development mode

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Build Errors:**
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# Fix any reported issues and rebuild
```

**GitHub Pages Not Working:**
- Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in repo settings
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

**Domain Issues:**
- Custom domains can be configured in platform settings
- DNS changes may take 24-48 hours to propagate
